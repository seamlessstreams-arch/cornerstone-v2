# Cara Studio — Technical Documentation

## Overview

Cara Studio is a NotebookLM-style intelligence and creative studio purpose-built for children's residential care. It enables Registered Managers, team leaders, and care workers to generate, review, approve, and commit professional documents — all grounded in real evidence and governed by a human-in-the-loop approval workflow.

**Core principle:** Cara never writes the final record. It drafts. A human always reviews, amends, and approves before anything becomes official.

## Architecture

```
Database (18 tables)
  └─ Types (src/types/aria-studio.ts)
      └─ Services (src/lib/aria-studio/*.service.ts)
          └─ API Routes (src/app/api/aria-studio/*)
              └─ UI Pages (src/app/(platform)/aria-studio/*)
```

## Approval Workflow

```
draft → in_review → changes_requested → approved → committed
                  → rejected
```

- **Draft:** AI-generated content with watermark. Editable by creator.
- **In Review:** Submitted for manager review. Read-only for creator.
- **Changes Requested:** Returned with feedback. Creator can edit and resubmit.
- **Approved:** Manager has approved. Ready to commit to the official record.
- **Committed:** Version saved and linked to the filing cabinet. Immutable.

## Quality Check Engine

13 deterministic checks run on every generated artifact:

1. `evidence_cited` — References specific dated evidence
2. `child_voice_considered` — Captures wishes, feelings, or direct quotes
3. `risk_considered` — Addresses risk explicitly
4. `safeguarding_considered` — References safeguarding where relevant
5. `regulation_considered` — Cites relevant regulations
6. `actions_clear` — Contains actionable next steps
7. `owner_assigned` — Actions have named owners
8. `review_date_set` — Includes a review/follow-up date
9. `sensitive_language_reviewed` — No dignity violations
10. `no_unsupported_claims` — No definitive conclusions without evidence
11. `no_ai_style_filler` — No AI-typical filler phrases (20 patterns)
12. `dignity_language_passed` — No dehumanising language (11 patterns with suggestions)
13. `human_approval_complete` — Manager has reviewed and approved

## Evidence Confidence Scoring

7 dimensions with weighted overall score:

| Dimension | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Relevance | 20% | How relevant to the artifact context |
| Recency | 20% | How recent (7 days = 100, 365+ days = 20) |
| Reliability | 20% | Source type reliability (incident: 90, daily_log: 75) |
| Approval | 15% | Approval status (approved: 100, draft: 30) |
| Corroboration | 10% | Supported by other sources |
| Child Voice | 10% | Contains the young person's own words |
| Contradiction | 5% | Not contradicted by other evidence |

## Safeguarding Pattern Engine

Scans evidence for 12 pattern types using keyword detection:

- Missing episode escalation
- Exploitation indicators
- Online safety risks
- Peer-on-peer concerns
- Self-harm escalation
- Substance misuse patterns
- Concerning contact
- Isolation increase
- Emotional deterioration
- Allegation patterns
- Staff practice drift
- Education refusal escalation

**Important:** Cara never makes safeguarding decisions. It surfaces possible patterns for professional review.

## Permissions

7 permissions added to the RBAC system:

| Permission | RM | Deputy | TL | RCW | Bank |

## Demo / Stub Mode

When `AI_PROVIDER=stub` or no API key is configured, all services fall back to realistic demo content. Every stub response:

- Contains a `DEMO MODE` watermark
- Returns domain-appropriate content for the artifact type
- Includes all required structural elements
- Works without Supabase (in-memory fallback)

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `AI_PROVIDER` | No | `stub` | `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, or `stub` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | If OpenAI | — | OpenAI API key |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | If Anthropic | — | Anthropic API key |
| `AI_DEFAULT_MODEL` | No | `gpt-4.1-mini` | Model to use for generation |
| `ARIA_MAX_SOURCE_TOKENS` | No | `8000` | Max tokens from source context |
| `SUPABASE_HOME_ID` | No | Auto | Tenant home ID |
