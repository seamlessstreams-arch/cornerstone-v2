// CaraWriteToChild — Trauma-informed "Writing to the Child" generator
//
// Creates child-understandable versions of management oversight, incident
// records, complaints, missing-from-care returns, and session summaries.
// Aligns with ARC (Attachment, Regulation, Competency), PACE (Playfulness,
// Acceptance, Curiosity, Empathy), relational safeguarding, and Ofsted
// readiness. Every output goes through a Child Lens Check before commit.
//
// Dual output mode: management version + child-friendly version
// Full audit trail for Reg 44, Reg 45, and internal QA
