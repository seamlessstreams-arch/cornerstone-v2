              Every child arriving at Oak House should feel expected, wanted, and thought about.
              Welcome packs are personalised using advance information — never generic.
              First impressions matter: a child who feels welcomed is more likely to settle,
              attach, and thrive. We ask: &quot;Would a good parent do this for their child?&quot;

          Quality Standard 1 (Child-Centred Care) requires that children feel welcome, safe, and
          valued from the point of admission. Regulation 14 (Admissions) requires preparation for
          the child&apos;s arrival. The SCCIF examines whether children feel they &quot;belong&quot;
          and whether the home makes efforts to understand and meet their individual needs from
          day one. Personalised welcome packs demonstrate that the child was expected, thought
          about, and prepared for — not just &quot;placed.&quot;
