          Each child has an individualised welfare check protocol that balances safeguarding with
          dignity and the child's expressed wishes. Protocols are co-produced where possible,
          recorded clearly, and reviewed at least monthly or following any significant change in risk
          or presentation. Staff are inducted on each child's protocol before lone shifts. This page
          supports compliance with the Children's Homes (England) Regulations 2015 and the Guide to
          the Children's Homes Regulations.
