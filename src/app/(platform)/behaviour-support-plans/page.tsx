          <strong>SEND Code of Practice, Regulation 19 & Trauma-Informed Practice:</strong>{" "}
          Behaviour support plans must be developed in line with the SEND Code of Practice (2015)

          must prioritise positive behaviour support, de-escalation, and trauma-informed approaches.
          Restrictive interventions are a last resort only. Each plan must reflect the child&apos;s voice,
          involve multi-agency professionals, and be reviewed regularly. The home must ensure all
          staff are trained in the approaches outlined and that plans are accessible to the full team.
