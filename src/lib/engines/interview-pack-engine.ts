// CARA — INTERVIEW PACK ENGINE (pure / deterministic)
//
// Assembles a structured, values-aligned interview pack for a children's-home
// role — values, safeguarding, trauma-informed practice, PACE/co-regulation,
// scenario and (for senior roles) leadership questions, each with scoring
// guidance and red-flag prompts. Optionally enriched with the home's Employer
// Values Profile and a candidate's match-derived probes (from Slice 1).
//
// SUPPORT, not a decision: the pack structures a fair, consistent interview. The
// panel scores and decides using safer-recruitment practice and professional
// judgement. Scoring categories mirror the existing CandidateInterview/
// InterviewScore model so a completed pack maps straight onto the recruitment
// record.
