// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// Cara — HR PROCESS GUARDIAN
//
// Reviews a draft HR action (letter, meeting outcome, suspension decision,
// disciplinary outcome, grievance response, probation decision, sickness
// meeting outcome) BEFORE the manager approves it. Checks fairness, ACAS-
// aligned process, safeguarding linkage, proportionality, discrimination
// risk, evidence quality, representation rights, appeal rights, and the
// wording of the draft itself.
//
// Output is "Cara suggested draft" — never final until a human approves.
//
// Pipeline:
//   1. Deterministic rule-based analysis (audit-traceable, runs offline)
//   2. Optional LLM enhancement (Anthropic) for safer-wording suggestion
//   3. Returns the typed GuardianReview the API persists to Supabase
//
// Companion module to:
//   - managementOversightEngine.ts (single record oversight)
//   - voiceOfChildSummariser.ts (voice across many records)
//   - this engine (HR action fairness gate)
//
// All three share writingStyleRules.ts for the human tone.
