// The knowledge base: PACE scripts (Dan Hughes / DDP), the deterministic
// detection lexicons used by the analyzer, the safety disclaimer, and the
// per-element practice prompts. Faithful to DDP: Acceptance is of the child's
// inner experience (never unsafe behaviour); Curiosity is non-judgemental and
// never "why did you do that?"; Empathy says the child is not alone; Playfulness
// only where safe — never during distress, disclosure, restraint or risk.
