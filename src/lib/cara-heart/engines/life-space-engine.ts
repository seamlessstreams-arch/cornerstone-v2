// CARA HEART — LifeSpaceInterventionEngine (pure / deterministic)
//
// Identifies meaningful practice moments in ordinary daily life. Treats the
// "other twenty-three hours" of residential care as the primary therapeutic
// medium. Detects life-space moments and surfaces their practice value.
//
// Based on the principle that in residential care the daily living environment
// is the intervention — mealtimes, bedtimes, car journeys, conversations,
// conflicts and moments of repair are all therapeutic events.
