// CARA — Cara POST-INCIDENT ENGINE (pure / deterministic)
//
// Slice B of the Practice Assistant: the restorative-conversation template and
// the post-incident reflection — both tied to an incident session. Complements
// (does not replace) the standalone child/staff debrief logs that already exist.
//
// The engine provides the question templates, derives suggested follow-up
// actions from what staff actually recorded (deterministic mapping — explainable,
// no AI required), assembles factual summaries, and decides when manager review
// is required. AI (where used, in the route) only drafts a summary for staff to
// accept or reject — it never writes conclusions on its own.
