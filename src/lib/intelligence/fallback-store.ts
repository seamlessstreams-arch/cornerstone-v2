I have reviewed this incident involving a physical intervention with Alex on 5 May 2026.

What was reviewed:
The incident record, the immediate action taken, the staff accounts, and the child's response following the incident.

What happened:
Alex became increasingly distressed during the evening routine. Staff report that verbal de-escalation, distraction, and offers of alternative activity were attempted before any physical intervention was considered. When Alex moved towards the kitchen area where other children were present and began throwing items, staff made the decision to use a brief physical intervention to guide Alex to a quieter space.

Impact on the child:
Alex was visibly distressed during and immediately after the intervention. Staff remained with Alex and offered comfort. Alex was able to talk about what happened approximately 30 minutes later. Alex's voice should be formally captured through key work.

Staff response:
Staff attempted proportionate de-escalation strategies before physical intervention. The intervention described appears brief and proportionate to the immediate risk. Staff remained with Alex afterwards and offered support.

Were existing plans followed:
The behaviour support plan includes guidance on de-escalation. The records suggest staff followed the plan. However, the plan may need reviewing if the triggers described are not currently captured in the plan.

Safeguarding considerations:
Any physical intervention involving a child requires consideration of whether the LADO threshold is met. On the basis of what is recorded, the intervention appears proportionate, but the manager should satisfy themselves of this and record their reasoning.

Has risk changed:
Three incidents involving similar behaviour within 14 days suggest the risk assessment may not fully reflect Alex's current presentation. A review of the risk assessment is recommended.

Management decision:
[To be completed by the Registered Manager]

Next actions:
- Key work session with Alex to capture wishes and feelings
- Risk assessment review
- Staff debrief
- Consider whether behaviour support plan update is needed
- Consider whether social worker and placing authority should be updated

Review timeframe:
Next review within 48 hours to confirm actions have been progressed.`;
