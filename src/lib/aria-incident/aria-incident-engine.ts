// The live-incident core of the Cara Practice Assistant: incident types, per-type
// workflow checklists, the co-regulation prompt bank, child-voice prompts, the
// pre-save quality gate, and a deterministic draft-record assembler (the no-LLM
// fallback that NEVER invents facts — it only re-presents what staff recorded).
//
// Design principle (hard contract): AI suggests. Staff decide. Manager reviews.
// System audits. Cara never replaces professional judgement, never makes
// safeguarding decisions, and never states that a Regulation 40 notification is
// definitely required — only that the manager should consider it.
