// CARA — PERSISTENCE MANIFEST
//
// The honest, single source of truth for "what survives a redeploy?".
// Rendered on /data-persistence and returned by /api/v1/system/persistence.
// Two modes:
//   • Demo (Supabase off): everything runs on the seeded in-memory store —
//     fast, safe, resets on redeploy/instance recycle.
//   • Durable (Supabase on): entities marked `write_through: true` are written
//     to their real table as they're created, and read back through the dal.
//
// Keep this list TRUTHFUL — a wrong "true" here is worse than a gap.
