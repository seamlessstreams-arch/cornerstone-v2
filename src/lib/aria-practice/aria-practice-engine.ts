// ARIA PRACTICE INTELLIGENCE — DETERMINISTIC RULE ENGINE
//
// Pure, deterministic, no DB calls, no LLM. Works fully before any AI provider is
// connected. It DRAFTS prompts, ADVISES with reflective/threshold questions, and
// RECOGNISES weak recording, developmental gaps, overstated protective factors,
// safeguarding threshold + LADO concerns, relationship depth, and staff wellbeing.
//
// SAFETY: ARIA advises; managers decide. The engine never makes a final statutory
// decision, never blames a child, never treats wellbeing as disciplinary evidence,
// and always advises emergency action where immediate danger is described.
