-- 421 — Security: scope child-data RLS policies to the caller's home
--
-- From an authentication/authorization review. Migrations 010 and 011 created
-- read policies on child-data tables as `to authenticated using (true)` — i.e.
-- ANY authenticated user, in ANY home, could read EVERY home's oversight reviews
-- (child_id + oversight drafts + safeguarding/missing-from-care records) and
-- voice-of-the-child summaries via the Supabase Data API. The original comments
-- noted home scoping was "expected to be enforced via the application layer" —
-- which does not happen, so this migration enforces it at the database instead
-- (defence in depth: RLS holds even if a route forgets the check).
--
-- It replaces those 5 `using (true)` policies with home-scoped equivalents built
-- on the existing get_my_home_id() helper (003_rls_policies.sql). The parent
-- tables carry home_id directly; the child/audit tables are scoped through their
-- FK to the parent. The service_role policies are intentionally left untouched —
-- the server (service key) legitimately bypasses RLS for trusted writes.
--
-- ⚠️  REVIEW BEFORE APPLYING TO PRODUCTION — this was authored without access to
--     a live Supabase and has NOT been executed. In particular verify:
--       • get_my_home_id() returns uuid; these tables declare `home_id text`, so
--         the comparison casts the function result to text (`::text`). Confirm the
--         stored home_id values are the uuid strings of staff_members.home_id
--         (not slugs like 'home_oak'); if the schema standardises home_id types,
--         drop the cast.
--       • Run in a staging project and confirm a same-home user still reads their
--         own rows while a cross-home user reads none.
--
-- NOT fixed here (need per-table review — different shapes / generated policy
-- names): the dynamic `execute format(... using (true) ...)` policies in
-- 013_aria_universal_layer.sql and 014_aria_suggestions.sql, and the tables
-- created without RLS enabled in 019, 020, 024, 025, 026, 027.
